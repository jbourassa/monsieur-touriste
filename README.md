# Monsieur Touriste

**Monsieur Touriste is not up yet â€“ I am still working on some design issues.**

Monsieur Touriste is a toy project and a Sinatra experiment that came to life
while I was visiting Europe. The basic idea is to look very tourist-ish and/or
dumb with well known locations in the background. Hopefully the number of
pictures will grow fast.

Thanks to @LP_Cloutier for his input, pictures and good laughs.

## Running the project

Monsieur Touriste runs on top of Unicorn, Sinatra and pretty much any
databsase supported by DataMapper.
